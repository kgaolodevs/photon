# Photon
A dynamic wallpaper generating application

## About
- The app helps users find high-definition, royalty-free images based on a specific search term, as well as provide a reference to the author. This removes the hassle of having to sift through thousands of Google image search results, filter them by usage rights, and get the appropriate quality. The search is written using Async/Await, and is handled by a third-party external API that provides the app with the needed data to display the image search results. 
- Technologies used: HTML, CSS, SASS, BEM, JavaScript ES6, Font-awesome, UnsplashAPI
